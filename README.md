# Getting Started WeatherApp Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to fork

`gh repo clone leeboy1984/weatherapp_front`

## Set Weather API Endpoint

You need to open `.env` file and set `WEATHER_API_ENDPOINT` to your own API. In case you do not have any deployed you can use mine `https://api.weatherapp.abelzafra.es`

Since is bootstrapped with Create React, once you have configured API EndPoint you can use any of the followings scripts

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`
